<div style="width: 40%; height: 750px;" id="1">    <p>This experiment tests the probabilities of winning a game show based on <strong>Monty Hall</strong>. The Monty Hall problem is famous for generating <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24045598">heated discussions</a> about the probabilities and outcomes from switching or not switching the chosen door. Refer to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Wikipedia page</a> to better understand the problem.</p>
    <p>In the game, the following steps take place:</p>
    <ol>
	<li>There are 3 doors, behind one there is a car and behind the other 2, goats</li>
    <li>The player choses a door</li>
    <li>The host then opens one of the remaining doors, revealing one of the goats</li>
    <li>The player has the chance to keep the original choice or switch the the remaining closed door</li>
    <li>Once the player has chosen, the selected door is opened, revealing the prize</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There is a strong argument for always switching. Not intuitively, by eliminating one of the two doors not chosen, the probability collapses into the remaining closed door, as is proven by the experiment.
